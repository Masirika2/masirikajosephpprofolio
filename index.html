                <h2>FUNGULO MASIRIKA JOSEPH</h2>
                <p>I’m Fungulo Masirika Joseph I was born in DRCongo, South-Kivu province in
                     1999 October 11th. Nowadays I’m living in Uganda especially at Bugema 
                     University where I’m pursuing my high studies education in Business computing. 
                     Moreover, I thank Lord for his grace and protection to me and to my siblings again 
                     because both of my parents are still a live   this is a big opportunity we  can’t forget
                      to praise Lord. Indeed, I have done my primary school at EMPK/ Kavumu then my secondary 
                      School at CS AMEN in Goma town where I have gotten my   state diploma of 61% in business
                       management. Since my childhood I was always a competitive child in everything I was doing 
                       until now I still have this strength. By the way I’m a sport man because I can’t spend
                        a single day without doing some exercise and my favorite sports are karate ,football ,body building ,
                        volleyball and marathon really in all of these kind of sport I can be able to manager them without
                         any  problem. Furthermore ,   I have also some  skills in IT ,leadership, entrepreneurship and 
                         others  as human beings also I have my strengths and weakness let me tell you some of my strengths 
                         firstly I’m a God fearing person, secondly I’m humble person thirdly I have a hearth of sharing
                          with people, now one of my greatest weakness is when I’m new somewhere it  is difficult for 
                          me to become a accustomed  with new people but I’m always working on this issue  as they have 
                          taugth  us at CIYOTA/DRC none is perfect but we need to learn and change our behaviors  because  
                          change it is a process , it is not like you can weak up now and  found yourself already changed
                           we must work hard if we want to change our lives and it’s not only having money that means you have
                      but  change is when you have left all your bad actions and you have taken a new direction my God bless you.</p>
